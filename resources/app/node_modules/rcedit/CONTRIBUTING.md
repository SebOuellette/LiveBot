## Bugs / Feature Requests

## Releases

`node-rcedit` uses `semantic-release` plus a plugin named "continuous factor authentication" to
publish new releases to NPM. When a pull request is merged, a new release is queued in CircleCI, and
a member of the Electron [Docs & Tools Working Group](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-docs-tools) needs to approve it.
